# Statistical-inference-and-experimental-design-in-R
Practice of the lessons learned during the course series "Statistics with R" at DataCamp.

Much of the content in these courses is not included, I have included the parts that I think are most relevant and examples that are easy to understand. Especially the infer library is quite new and makes it very easy to make statistical inferences.

You will find some theory and interpretation of the different results. 
I hope you find it useful to improve your understanding of statistical inference.
